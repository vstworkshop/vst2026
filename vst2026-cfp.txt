VST 2026

9th International Workshop on 
Validation, Analysis and Evolution of Software Tests

March 17, 2026 – co-located with SANER 2026, Limassol, Cyprus
https://vstworkshop.github.io/vst2026/

*******************************************************************************

Software projects accumulate large sets of test cases, encoding valuable expert 
knowledge about the software under test to the extent of many person years. 
Over time the reliability of the tests decreases, and they become difficult to 
understand and maintain. Extra effort is required for repairing broken tests 
and for adapting test suites and models to evolving software systems.

The International Workshop on Validation, Analysis and Evolution of Software 
Tests (VST) is a unique event bringing together academics, industrial 
researchers, and practitioners for exchanging experiences, solutions and new 
ideas in applying methods, techniques and tools from software analysis, 
evolution and re-engineering to advance the state of the art in test 
development and maintenance.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Analysis and validation of test code, test data, and test models
* Test execution monitoring, results analysis, and visualization
* Fault detection and localization 
* Co-evolution of tests and production code
* Test case maintenance and automated repair
* Clone detection for test code and data
* Test generation and amplification
* Test prioritization, minimization and simplification
* Application of generative AI and LLMs in testing
* Combinations of the topics above

 
Submission:

We encourage submission of papers on the topics mentioned above: Full papers (8 pages), 
position papers and tool demonstration papers (2 to 4 pages).
Papers must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines and need to be 
prepared for a full double-blind review process. If the paper is 
accepted, at least one author must attend the workshop and present the paper. 

Submission is done via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vst2026).
